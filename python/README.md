# Original python implementation

This is the original python implementation with some minor refactoring
to make it more readable. 

Taken from https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/

This is what I used as reference for tests results too, so whenever I check for a
particular result in the Rust tests, it's because the given function returned that
result with those parameters.
